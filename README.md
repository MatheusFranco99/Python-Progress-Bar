# Python-Progress-Bar

This modules is an example of progress bar in python.  
It uses the character '\r' (carriage return) which set the cursor to the  
beginning of the line instead of jumping to the next line.

For it to work, you should have _colorama_ installed. For that run

```
pip3 install colorama
```
or
```
pip install colorama
```

To run the program, run in the command line:
```
python3 progressBar.py
```
